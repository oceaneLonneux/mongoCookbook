#Chef Configuration Lab
##Timings
60 - 90 Minutes
##Summary
Our Mongo cookbook currently only install mongodb but it is not configured or started. Let's used templates and attributes to configure the cookbook
##Tasks
###Add new ChefSpec tests for the following:
Create a mongod.conf file in /etc/mongod.conf
Create a mongod.service file in /lib/systemd/system/mongod.service
MongoDB service should be enabled
MongoDB service should be started
###And InSpec tests for the following:
MongoDB is running
MongoDB is enabled
MongoDB is listening on 27017 by default
MongoDB is listening on 0.0.0.0 by default
Create a recipe that installs and configures this cookbook correctly to pass all these tests.
Use attributes to allow the port number and ip to be configurable.
